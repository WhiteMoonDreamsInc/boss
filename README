NAME: boss

AUTHOR: BJ Dierkes <derks@bjdierkes.com>

DESCRIPTION:

The Boss project provides 'Baseline Open Source Software' templates and 
development tools.  It has similarities to Paste Script with regards to 
templating, but far easier to extend.  Though Boss is written in Python, it is 
not limited to any particular language. Boss is very beta... any feedback is 
welcome and appreciated.

Features:

 * Supports multiple local, and remote (git) template sources
 * Templates can easily be created and customized to the developers needs
 * Support for remote files within templates (i.e. github/gitignore files)
 
Other sites that might be helpful.
